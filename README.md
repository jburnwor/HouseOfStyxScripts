# HouseOfStyxScripts

House of Styx is a dark surrealist, violent action game following George as he delves deep into his mind to fight and overcome his traumatic past.

This is a collection of the scripts from the game since our team used Unity Collab.

I mainly worked on the AI for the game. It is based off of the unity tutorial for plugable AI using a finite state machine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHUXh5biQMg&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0ROSj_B0_eir_VkHrEkd4pi

If I refactor or could create the AI again I would create seperate state controllers for every enemy type to avoid redundant or unused code that is enemy type specific being used by every enemy.
